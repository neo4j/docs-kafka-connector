Many user and customers want to integrate Kafka and other streaming solutions with Neo4j.
Either to ingest data into the graph from other sources.
Or to send update events (change data capture - CDC) to the event log for later consumption.

{product-name} can run as a **Kafka-Connect Plugin** for the Confluent Platform.
It allows to ingest data into Neo4j, from Kafka topics, or publishing data to them via Cypher queries.


// [[kafka_connect_neo4j_connector_overview]]
== {product-name}

**{product-name}** is deployed separately from the Neo4j database.
At this time, the Connect Worker can be used both to push data to Neo4j and to publish data from the database itself.


== Compatibility between Neo4j and {product-name}

We recommend the latest version of {product-name} to be compatible with all versions of Neo4j.
