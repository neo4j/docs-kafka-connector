The Neo4j Connector for Apache Kafka and Neo4j Connector for Confluent are designed for customers who want to stream data from distributed event stores and streaming platforms like Apache Kafka (TM) into Neo4j or Aura to make decisions in real time.

Both connectors can be used to sink data into Aura and Neo4j from Kafka Topics (ingest), or as a source of updates and new data (change data capture - CDC) for Kafka Topics to be consumed by other systems.

The Neo4j Connector for Confluent runs as a **Kafka Connect Plugin** on the Confluent Platform and can be deployed into the Confluent Cloud using their Custom Connectors. 
It is available from the link:https://www.confluent.io/hub/neo4j/kafka-connect-neo4j[Confluent Hub], or from the link:https://neo4j.com/download-center[Neo4j Download Center].

The Neo4j Connector for Apache Kafka runs as a **Kafka Connect Plugin** on Apache Kafka and can be deployed into Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK). 
It is available from the link:https://neo4j.com/download-center[Neo4j Download Center].
