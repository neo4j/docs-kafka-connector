= Configuring source connector
:page-aliases: kafka-connect/source.adoc

In this chapter we'll discuss how the Source instance is configured.

== Strategies

Source connector can be configured with two different strategies:

xref:source/cdc.adoc[Change Data Capture]:: Uses database's link:{page-canonical-root}/cdc[Change Data Capture] feature to query changes happening in the database and publishes Kafka messages out of them.
xref:source/query.adoc[Query]:: Uses a user defined Cypher query to detect changes and publishes Kafka messages out of them.

[IMPORTANT]
Source connector always generates messages with schema support, and you will need to pick your key and value converters accordingly.
