= Configuring source connector
:page-aliases: kafka-connect/source.adoc

In this chapter we'll discuss how the Source instance is configured.

== Strategies

The Source connector can use two different strategies to detect changes and publish them as Kafka messages:

xref:source/cdc.adoc[Change Data Capture]:: Uses the database's link:{page-canonical-root}/cdc[Change Data Capture] feature to track all changes happening to the database in real time.
xref:source/query.adoc[Query]:: Runs a user-defined Cypher query to track specific changes.

[IMPORTANT]
The Source connector always generates messages with schema support, so you need to use key and value converters accordingly.
