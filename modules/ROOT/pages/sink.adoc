= Configuring sink connector
:page-aliases: kafka-connect/sink.adoc

In this chapter we'll discuss how the Sink instance is configured.

== Strategies

Sink connector can be configured with different strategies:

xref:sink/cypher.adoc[Cypher]::
Expose incoming Kafka messages into user provided Cypher query as parameters and execute it against the target database.
xref:sink/cdc.adoc[Change Data Capture]::
Process incoming Kafka messages generated by either a Source instance configured with xref:source/cdc.adoc[Change Data Capture strategy] or our deprecated link:{page-canonical-root}/kafka-streams[Neo4j Streams plugin], and apply the change to the target database.
xref:sink/pattern.adoc[Pattern]::
Transform incoming Kafka messages into Cypher queries using Cypher-like pattern syntax and apply them to the target database.
xref:sink/cud.adoc[Create Update Delete (CUD) File]::
Transform incoming CUD formatted messages into Cypher queries and apply them to the target database.
