= Configuring sink connector
:page-aliases: kafka-connect/sink.adoc

In this chapter we'll discuss how the Sink instance is configured.

== Strategies

The Sink connector can use different strategies to write Kafka messages into a Neo4j database:

xref:sink/cypher.adoc[Cypher]::
Use the incoming Kafka messages as parameters of a user-provided Cypher write query.
xref:sink/cdc.adoc[Change Data Capture]::
Process incoming Kafka messages generated by either a Source instance configured with xref:source/cdc.adoc[Change Data Capture strategy] or the deprecated link:{page-canonical-root}/kafka-streams[Neo4j Streams plugin], then apply the changes directly to the target database.
xref:sink/pattern.adoc[Pattern]::
Use a Cypher-like pattern syntax to transform incoming Kafka messages into Cypher write queries.
xref:sink/cud.adoc[Create Update Delete (CUD) File]::
Transform incoming CUD-formatted messages into Cypher write queries.
