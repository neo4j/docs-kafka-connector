= Configuring sink connector

In this chapter we'll discuss how the Sink instance is configured.

== Strategies

Sink connector can be configured with different strategies:

* by providing a Cypher query
* by ingesting change events emitted from another Neo4j instance, either by a source connector instance configured for xref:source/cdc.adoc#kafka-connect-source-cdc-strategy[Change Data Capture] or the deprecated link:{page-canonical-root}/kafka-streams[Neo4j streams plugin].
* by providing a pattern which extracts graph entities from incoming message
* by generating messages in CUD file format which are translated into Cypher queries
