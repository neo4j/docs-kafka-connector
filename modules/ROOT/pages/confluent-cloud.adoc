= Confluent Cloud Support

If you need to run the {product-name} as a managed service as part of Confluent Cloud, this is currently not possible.
Users who are interested in running {product-name} as a Cloud managed connector by Confluent should raise this with Confluent.
Right now there are only a few connectors such as that for S3 that can be run as managed services.
Click {url-confluent-cloud}/connectors/index.html[here] to learn more.

Other references to how to configure it to connect to the Confluent Cloud can be found at the following links:
