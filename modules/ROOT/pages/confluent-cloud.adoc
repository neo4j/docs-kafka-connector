= Confluent Cloud quickstart

Neo4j supports the Confluent Cloud with the Neo4j Connector for Confluent running as a Custom Connector. 
Confluent's Custom Connectors provide a way to extend the Confluent Cloud beyond the fully managed connectors available on their platform.

Custom Connectors are Kafka Connect plugins created by users, modified open-source connector plugins, or third-party connector plugins like the Neo4j Connector for Confluent. 
Find out more about Custom Connectors in the link:https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/bring-your-connector/overview.html[Confluent documentation].
