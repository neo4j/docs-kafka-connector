= Confluent Cloud Support

Neo4j supports the Confluent Cloud with the Neo4j Connector for Confluent running as a Custom Connector. 
Confluent's Custom Connectors provide a way to extend the Confluent Cloud beyond the fully managed connectors available on their platform.

Custom Connectors are Kafka Connect plugins created by users, modified open-source connector plugins, or third-party connector plugins like the Neo4j Connector for Confluent. 
Find out more about Custom Connectors link:https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/bring-your-connector/overview.html[here]. 

Confluent Cloud does not provide the Neo4j Connector for Confluent as a managed connector, if you are interested in a managed connector please raise the request with Confluent.
