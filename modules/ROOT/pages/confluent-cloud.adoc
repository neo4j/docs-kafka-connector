= Quickstart with Confluent Cloud
:xrefstyle: full

include::partial$third-party.adoc[]

Neo4j supports the Confluent Cloud with the Neo4j Connector for Confluent running as a Custom Connector.
Confluent's Custom Connectors provide a way to extend the Confluent Cloud beyond the fully managed connectors available on their platform.

== Prerequisites

* An AuraDB Enterprise or a Neo4j Enterprise on-prem deployment, with CDC enabled, which is accessible through public internet.
Follow link:{page-canonical-root}/cdc/get-started/aura[Enable CDC on Neo4j Aura] or link:{page-canonical-root}/cdc/get-started/on-prem[Enable CDC on Neo4j DBMS] for instructions.

* An environment and a running cluster must be available at link:{url-confluent-cloud}[Confluent Cloud], similar to what's shown in <<running-cluster>>.

== Upload Custom Connectors

Before creating our connector instances, we first need to define {product-name} as Custom Connectors.

:type: sink
:type-text: Sink
include::partial$confluent-cloud-add-plugin.adoc[]

Custom Connectors are Kafka Connect plugins created by users, modified open-source connector plugins, or third-party connector plugins like the Neo4j Connector for Confluent.
Find out more about Custom Connectors in the link:https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/bring-your-connector/overview.html[Confluent documentation] and read our link:https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/confluent-cloud-neo4j-auradb-connector-2[blog post] which includes a worked example on how to set this up with Aura.

You can create a connector from Confluent Cloud to Neo4j and link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/auradb/[Neo4j AuraDB] by following the instructions on the link:https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/confluent-cloud-neo4j-auradb-connector-2/[Neo4j Developer Blog].

== Create Source Instance

Having created our custom connectors in the previous section, we can now start configuring our Source instance.

. In Confluent Cloud, go to Connectors section for your cluster and search for plugin `Neo4j Connector for Confluent Source` which we have created in xref:upload-connector-source[above], as shown in <<find-source-connector>>.
+
[[find-source-connector]]
.Find custom Source connector
image::confluent-cloud/cc-connectors-source.png[width=800]

. Click on the connector to start configuring our source connector instance.

. Configure an API Key for accessing your Kafka cluster, and click Continue.
+
[[configure-source-connector-api-key]]
.Configure API Key
image::confluent-cloud/cc-connectors-source-api-key.png[width=800]

. First click `Auto Configure Schema Registry` and select either of `JSON Schema`, `Avro` or `Protobuf` based on your preferences, and click `Apply changes`.
This will generate a couple of configuration options for schema support.
Next, configure the connector configuration options either as individual key value pairs or adding into the existing JSON.
For quickstart, we will configure our source instance so that it will send change event messages on nodes matching pattern `(:TestSource)` over to the topics named `creates`, `updates` and `deletes`, using your preferred serialization format.

. At the next screen, we need to add connection endpoints so that our connector can access Neo4j or AuraDB.
Extract your hostname and port from Neo4j Connection URI, and add it as an endpoint.
Remember that default port number for Neo4j connections is `7687`.
For example, for connection URI `neo4j+s://<redacted>.databases.neo4j.io` we should enter `<redacted>.databases.neo4j.io:7687` as an endpoint.
+
[[configure-source-connector-endpoint]]
.Configure Endpoints
image::confluent-cloud/cc-connectors-source-endpoint.png[width=800]

. Next, select how many tasks your connector should run with and click `Continue`.
Source connectors always run with 1 task, so the default value of `1` would be enough.
+
[[configure-source-connector-task]]
.Configure Tasks
image::confluent-cloud/cc-connectors-source-tasks.png[width=800]

. Finally, name your connector instance, review your settings and click `Continue`.
+
[[configure-source-connector-review]]
.Review
image::confluent-cloud/cc-connectors-source-review.png[width=800]

. The source instance will be provisioned and will be shown as `Running` in a couple of minutes.
+
[[configure-source-connector-provision]]
.Review
image::confluent-cloud/cc-connectors-source-provision.png[width=800]

Now that you have a running source instance, you can create the following nodes in Neo4j:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (:TestSource {name: 'john', surname: 'doe'});
CREATE (:TestSource {name: 'mary', surname: 'doe'});
CREATE (:TestSource {name: 'jack', surname: 'small'});
----

This will result in new messages being published to the topic named `creates`.

== Create Sink Instance

Having created our Source instance in the previous section, we can now start configuring our Sink instance so that we can act upon messages generated by our Source instance.

. In Confluent Cloud, go to Connectors section for your cluster and search for plugin `Neo4j Connector for Confluent Sink` which we have created in xref:upload-connector-sink[above], as shown in <<find-sink-connector>>.
+
[[find-sink-connector]]
.Find custom Sink connector
image::confluent-cloud/cc-connectors-sink.png[width=800]

. Click on the connector to start configuring our sink connector instance.

. Configure an API Key for accessing your Kafka cluster, and click Continue.
+
[[configure-sink-connector-api-key]]
.Configure API Key
image::confluent-cloud/cc-connectors-sink-api-key.png[width=800]

. First click `Auto Configure Schema Registry` and select either of `JSON Schema`, `Avro` or `Protobuf` based on your preferences, and click `Apply changes`.
This will generate a couple of configuration options for schema support.
Next, configure the connector configuration options either as individual key value pairs or adding into the existing JSON.
For quickstart, we will configure our sink instance so that it will execute a Cypher statement for each message received from the topics named `creates`, `updates` and `deletes`.

== Testing It Out

Now you can access your Confluent Cloud cluster, and verify at least the `creates` topic is created as specified in the connector configuration.

With both source and sink connectors running, the previously created `:TestSource` nodes will result in messages being published into the `creates` topic by the source instance.
These messages will then be consumed by the sink instance, and corresponding `:Person` and `:Family` nodes to be created inside Neo4j.
As you create, update and delete the `TestSource` labelled nodes, `updates` and `deletes` topics will also be created.

Check that this is the case, by executing the following query in the Neo4j Browser at \http://localhost:7474/browser/:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:(Person | Family)) RETURN n
----

You can now create, update or delete Person and Family nodes by executing more statements like:

.Create a new person
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (:TestSource {name: 'Ann', surname: 'Bolin'});
----

Verify that a new `Person` and a new `Family` node is created and linked together.

.Update an existing person
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:TestSource {name: 'mary', surname: 'doe'}) SET n.surname = 'smith';
----

Verify that the existing `Person` node is now updated with a surname of `smith` and linked to a new `Family` node.

.Delete an existing person
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:TestSource {name: 'mary', surname: 'smith'}) DELETE n;
----

Verify that the existing `Person` node is now deleted.

=== Summary

In this quickstart, we have shown how to configure an AuraDB/Neo4j database to act as both the source of messages for Kafka topics and the sink for those same messages to create, update or delete nodes and relationships in the database.
Typically, our connector is used as either a sink when pulling data from other data sources via Confluent or as source for Confluent to push data into other databases.

=== Troubleshooting

- Make sure you have CDC enabled on your database.
- Make sure you have set the connection endpoints correctly as specified above.
- Check logs for the connector.
