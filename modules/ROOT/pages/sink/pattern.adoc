= Pattern strategy

This strategy allows you to extract nodes and relationships from a kafka message through extraction patterns.

== Node Patterns

Node patterns are defined similar to Cypher node patterns.

. Start with `(`.
. Define optional list of labels, separated by `:`, such as `:Person` or `:Person:Employee`.
. Open property section with `{`.
. Define properties to be treated as keys, each prepended with `!`, where at least one key property needs to be provided.
Individual message fields can be explicitly referenced and assigned to a user defined property in the format of `userId: \__key.user.id`.
By default, messages fields can be referenced as `__timestamp`, `\__headers`, `__key` and `__value`.
. Either;
.. Nothing or `*`, meaning that assign all properties from message to the node.
.. List of property names to be assigned to the node from message.
Individual message fields can be explicitly referenced and assigned to a user defined property in the format of `userName: \__value.user.name`.
By default, messages fields can be referenced as `__timestamp`, `\__headers`, `__key` and `__value`.
.. List of property names _not_ to be assigned to the node, each prepended with `-`, all other properties from message will be assigned to the node.
. Close property section with `}`.
. End with `)`.

[NOTE]
You cannot mix inclusion and exclusion inside patterns, i.e. your pattern must contain either all exclusion or inclusion properties.

=== Examples

* `MERGE` operation on `User` label with `userId` treated as a key and assigning all properties from incoming message value to the node
+
[source]
----
(:User{!userId})
----
+
or
+
[source]
----
(:User{!userId, *})
----

* `MERGE` operation on `User` label with `userId` treated as a key and assigning *only* `surname` property from incoming message to the node
+
[source]
----
(:User{!userId, surname})
----

* `MERGE` operation on `User` label with `userId` treated as a key and assigning *only* `surname` and `address.city` properties from incoming message to the node
+
[source]
----
(:User{!userId, surname, city: address.city})
----

* `MERGE` operation on `User` label with `userId` treated as key and assigning all properties excluding `address` property from incoming message to the node
+
[source]
----
(:User{!userId, -address})
----

* `MERGE` operation on `User` label with `userId` treated as key which will be taken from the key part of the message and assigning *only* `name` and `surname` properties from the value part of incoming message to the node
+
[source]
----
(:User{!userId: __key.id, name: __value.firstName, surname: __value.lastName})
----

* `MERGE` operation on `User` label with `userId` treated as key which will be taken from the key part of incoming message and assigning *only* `name`, `surname` properties from the value part, `createdBy` from the header and `createdAt` property as current timestamp to the node
+
[source]
----
(:User{!userId: __key.id, name: __value.firstName, surname: __value.lastName, createdBy: __header.username, createdAt: __timestamp})
----

=== Configuration

You can configure the node pattern as follows;

[source,json,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
"neo4j.pattern.node.topic.<TOPIC_NAME>": "<NODE_PATTERN>"
----

For instance, given the following `json` published via the `user` topic:

[source,json]
----
{"userId": 1, "name": "Andrea", "surname": "Santurbano", "address": {"city": "Venice", "cap": "30100"}}
----

You can transform it into a node by providing the following configuration:

[source,json,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
"neo4j.pattern.node.topic.user": "(:User{!userId})"
----

== Relationship Patterns

Relationship patterns are defined similar to Cypher relationship patterns.

. Node pattern for start node.
. `-[`
. Define relationship type, prepended by `:`, such as `:BOUGHT` or `:KNOWS`.
. Open property section with `{`.
. [Optional] Define properties to be treated as keys, each prepended with `!`, where at least one key property needs to be provided.
Individual message fields can be explicitly referenced and assigned to a user defined property in the format of `relationshipId: \__key.relationship.id`.
By default, messages fields can be referenced as `__timestamp`, `\__headers`, `__key` and `__value`.
. Either;
.. Nothing or `*`, meaning that assign all properties from message to the relationship.
.. List of property names to be assigned to the relationship from message.
Individual message fields can be explicitly referenced and assigned to a user defined property in the format of `relationshipType: \__value.relationship.type`.
By default, messages fields can be referenced as `__timestamp`, `\__headers`, `__key` and `__value`.
.. List of property names _not_ to be assigned to the relationship, each prepended with `-`, all other properties from message will be assigned to the relationship.
. Close property section with `}`.
. `]\->`
. Node pattern for end node.

[NOTE]
You cannot mix inclusion and exclusion inside patterns, i.e. your pattern must contains all exclusion or inclusion properties.

=== Examples

. `MERGE` operation on `User` and `Product` labels with `userId` and `productId` treated as keys respectively and `MERGE` a `BOUGHT` relationship between them assigning all other message properties to the relationship
+
[source]
----
(:User{!userId})-[:BOUGHT]->(:Product{!productId})
----

. `MERGE` operation on `User` and `Product` labels with `userId` and `productId` treated as keys respectively and `MERGE` a `BOUGHT` relationship between them assigning *only* `price` and `currency` properties from incoming message to the relationship
+
[source]
----
(:User{!userId})-[:BOUGHT{price,currency}]->(:Product{!productId})
----

. `MERGE` operation on `User` and `Product` labels with `userId` and `productId` treated as keys respectively and `MERGE` a `BOUGHT` relationship between them assigning *only* `price`,  `currency` and `shippingAddress.city` properties from incoming message to the relationship
+
[source]
----
(:User{!userId})-[:BOUGHT{price,currency,shippingAddress.city}]->(:Product{!productId})
----

. `MERGE` operation on `User` and `Product` labels with `userId` and `productId` treated as keys respectively and `MERGE` a `BOUGHT` relationship between them assigning all properties *excluding* `shippingAddress` from incoming message to the relationship
+
[source]
----
(:User{!userId})-[:BOUGHT{-shippingAddress}]->(:Product{!productId})
----

. `MERGE` operation on `User` and `Product` labels with `userId` and `productId` treated as keys respectively, assign `userFirstName` and `userLastName` properties from the message to the `User` node and `MERGE` a `BOUGHT` relationship between them assigning *only* `price` and `currency` properties from the message to the relationship
+
[source]
----
(:User{!userId, userFirstName, userLastName})-[:BOUGHT{price, currency}]->(:Product{!productId})
----

. `MERGE` operation on `User` and `Product` labels with `userId` and `productId` treated as keys respectively and `MERGE` a `BOUGHT` relationship between them assigning *only* `transactionId` property as a key property from key part of the message and `date` from value part of the message to the relationship
+
[source]
----
(:User{!userId})-[:BOUGHT{!transactionId: __key.transaction.id, date: __value.transaction.date}]->(:Product{!productId})
----

=== Configuration

You can configure the relationship pattern as follows;

[source,json,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
"neo4j.pattern.relationship.topic.<TOPIC_NAME>": "<RELATIONSHIP_PATTERN>"
----

For instance, given the following `json` published via the `user` topic:

[source,json]
----
{"userId": 1, "productId": 100, "price": 10, "currency": "â‚¬", "shippingAddress": {"city": "Venice", "cap": "30100"}}
----

You can transform it into a path, like `(n)-[r]->(m)`, by providing the following configuration:

[source,json,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
"neo4j.pattern.relationship.topic.user": "(:User{!userId})-[:BOUGHT{price, currency}]->(:Product{!productId})"
----

[NOTE]
Relationship key properties can only be used with Neo4j Enterprise Edition 5.7 and above, and AuraDB 5.

== Tombstone Records

The pattern strategy supports https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombstone_(data_store)[tombstone records].
In order to use it, message key should contain at least the key properties present in the provided pattern and message value should be set as `null`.

[IMPORTANT]
It is not possible to define multiple patterns for a single topic, such as extracting more than one node or relationship type from a single message.
In order to achieve this, you have to use a different topic for each pattern.
