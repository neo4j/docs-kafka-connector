Kafka Connect, an open source component of Apache Kafka, is a framework for connecting Kafka with external systems such
as databases, key-value stores, search indexes, and file systems.

Neo4j provides a {product-name} that can be installed into the Confluent Platform enabling:

- Ingesting data from Kafka topics directly into Neo4j via templated Cypher queries;
- Streaming data from Neo4j queries.
