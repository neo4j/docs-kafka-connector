* label:added[Resolved] Source connector with CDC strategy is being killed when it receives a change event that contains an update of type for a property.
An example of such a change is when a node that has a property named `age` was set to a string value of `"25"`, but updated to be an `int` value of `25`.
Change events with this condition will break schema derivation in the connector and a fix is being implemented to address this.
