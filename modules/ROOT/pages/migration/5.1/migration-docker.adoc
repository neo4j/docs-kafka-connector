= Migration on Confluent Platform

This guide follows the xref:quickstart-docker.adoc[].

.Steps
. Open the Confluent Control Center instance at `http://localhost:9021/clusters` and find the registered source or sink connector.
Once found, delete it.

. Look at the logs for the `connect` container (`docker-compose logs -f connect`).
A migrated configuration will be printed to the logs as part of the connector deletion/shutdown.
Example:
+
[source,shell]
----
include::example$docker-data/how-to-upgrade.migrated-config.log[]
----

. Create a new JSON file `(source/sink)_migrated.neo4j.json` and copy the migrated example config to this file along with the connector name.
The configuration should contain a `name` property and the migrated configuration should be nested in the `config` key.

. Download the new connector version following the xref:installation.adoc[] guide and remove the original 5.0.x connector version.
Make sure to copy the new plugin into the `./plugins/` folder created during the Docker setup.

. Restart the Kafka Connect Worker by running `docker-compose restart connect`.
This allows the Kafka Connect platform to pick up the new plugin from the `./plugins/` folder.

. Continue following the xref:quickstart-docker.adoc[] to deploy the plugin to Kafka Connect with the new configuration.

. Once the connector is up and running, validate it is successfully running.
